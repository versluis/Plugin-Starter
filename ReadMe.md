Plugin Starter
==============

This is template for developing plugins. It's a work in progress and will evolve as I find out more about how this works.


Basic Usage
============

The code is well documented and will by default add a new Admin Page under the Dashboard section. 

Branches
=========

Two branches exist in this project: the master branch for building a regular Plugin with Admin Page, Admin CSS and Admin JavaScripts, and a simpler version without an admin interface. The latter is essentially a single function that is called if the plugin is active.

Pick a branch and start deviating.
